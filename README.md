  See [the tutorial](https://github.com/xem/3DShomebrew/blob/gh-pages/tutorial.md). (a basic knowledge of programming is needed)

- Document all the features of ctrulib and the role of each function, as well as the 3DS inner workings.<br>
  See [3DS and ctrulib documentation](https://github.com/xem/3DShomebrew/blob/gh-pages/documentation.md).
  
- Provide some handy tools to ease your homebrew development.<br>
